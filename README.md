I have eaten a Snickers super bar, for instance. I want to know how it impact on  
my daily nutrition needs. I use this tool to know it.  

`go run main.go -w 95 -f "7.5/28.5/56/514" -d "90/90/340/2400"`  

-w Snickers weight in grams   
-f Snickers nutrition facts for 100 grams (proteins/fats/carbohydrates/calories)  
-d my daily nutrition needs  

I get the results:  

`7.92/30.08/15.65/20.35`  

I have covered 7.92% of proteins I need today and so on.
