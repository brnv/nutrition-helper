I have eat a snickers super bar, for instance. I want to know how it impact on  
my daily nutrition needs. I use this tool to know it.  

`go run main.go -n snickers -f "7.5/28.5/56/514" -w 95 -d "90/90/340/2400"`  

-n meal name  
-f meal nutrition facts (protein/fat/carbohydrate/calories)  
-w meal weight  
-d your daily nutrition needs  

I get the results  

`snickers/95.00/7.92/30.08/15.65/20.35`  

I have covered 7.92% of protein I need today and so on
